- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
